					<h1>
						C64 OS has one goal.<br>
						Make a Commodore 64 feel fast and useful in today&rsquo;s modern world.
					</h1>
					<p>
						It's a very high bar. The C64 was introduced in 1982 and has an 8-bit, 1MHZ, 6510 CPU 
						with just 64 kilobytes of directly addressable memory. It has a screen resolution of 
						320x200 pixels, and a fixed palette of 16 colors. But, it is an incredibly 
						versatile machine. And it enjoys an active userbase and a great variety of modern 
						hardware expansions.
					</p>
					<h3>
						The C64 has had many operating systems written for it, <sup><a href="#fn_h1" id="fnid_h1" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link">1</a></sup> 
						So why write another?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Some of these projects were designed to be experimental, 
						or to demonstrate a point, rather than to solve a problem or to make using the C64 
						better. Others had good intentions but pushed the machine in ways it wasn't designed
						for, compromising on speed and usability in the pursuit of features available on more
						powerful computers. The aim of C64 OS is to work with the limitations of the Commodore 64
						and enable it to become useful.

						<h2>Background</h2>
				
						<p>
							Every Commodore 64 comes with a built–in operating system. But it doesn't have a 
							unified marketing name, and it hasn't changed significantly in nearly 35 years. The
							C64's operating system is made up of two ROM chips on the motherboard.
							These are, the KERNAL rom and the BASIC rom. Each chip occupies 8 kilobytes of space 
							for a complete OS in a grand total of 16k. <sup><a href="#fn_c1" id="fnid_c1" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link">1</a></sup> 
						</p>
				
						<p>
							It's sometimes hard to notice that this is an operating system, because they are so
							tightly integrated with the hardware that it just feels like the way the machine 
							works. In fact, these two sets of code work beautifully together to implement 
							all of the user experience when the C64 is first turned on.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							The KERNAL provides much more than just low–level access to I/O devices. The KERNAL
							implements the C64's screen editor. This is what enables keypresses to produce text
							on the screen. The fact that the cursor moves one place to the right after each 
							character is typed is implemented by the KERNAL rom.
						</p>
						<p>
							PETSCII is a variant of ASCII used by Commodore 8-Bit computers. I often wondered 
							why Commodore bothered to use a proprietary text encoding. The answer is because of 
							the way the KERNAL works with the keyboard and the screen editor, and the way the
							character rom works with the VIC-II's video modes, and how BASIC interacts with the
							KERNAL. These components all come together in a tight and beautiful package that 
							we're all familiar with as the C64's blue screen of life.
						</p>
						<p>
							The problem is that many of the basic assumptions from 35 years ago about how a 
							computer should work are woefully insufficient for a modern computing experience.
						</p>
						
						<ol class='footnotes'>
							<li id="fn_c1" class="footnote">
								Plus a 4K character set ROM. [<a href="#fnid_c1" class="footnote-link footnote-back-link">&#8617;</a>]
							</li>
						</ol>
						
						<h2>Design Goals</h2>

						<p>
							The primary design goal of C64 OS is to be true to the hardware. This means to 
							work with it, the way the hardware wants to work. Not constantly fighting an uphill
							battle slowing the machine down trying to get it to do something it's not designed
							for.
						</p>

						<p>
							First this means C64 OS is not pre–emptively multi–tasking. It is unashamedly 
							unitasking. And second it is not attempting to ape the structure or the interaction 
							model of any other operating system. C64 OS is not a unix clone, nor is it a Windows
							or Mac OS clone. It is an experience that feels like it belongs on a C64.
						</p>
				
						<p>
							The goal is to provide a consistent user interface model against which 
							applications and utilities can easily be written. C64 OS tries to get out of the way
							as much as possible, while providing modern amenities to help write more powerful, 
							more capable and easier to use programs.
						</p>

						<p>
							C64 OS is written 100% in ASM and prioritizes its goals arounding making the C64 feel
							fresh, fast and responsive.
						</p>
				
						<h2>Features</h2>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Event–driven execution model</li>
							<li>Multi–layer text screen compositor</li>
							<li>Advanced mouse and keyboard event system</li>
							<li>Paged memory manager</li>
							<li>PETSCII/ASCII conversion</li>
							<li>Full-screen, menu based UI</li>
							<li>Standardized open and save file dialogs</li>
							<li>Efficient string and text management</li>
							<li>Universal cut, copy and paste</li>
							<li>Occupies 4K of resident memory</li>
							<li>Application launcher</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h2>Recommended Hardware</h2>

						<p>
							The C64 is awesome, but one of the things that makes it so awesome is that
							there is a vibrant community of hardware expansion options. C64 OS is designed
							to work with as minimal hardware as possible, a C64, a 1541 disk drive and a 
							1351 or compatible mouse.
						</p>
						<p>
							But the power comes in getting a few nice add-ons to bring your C64 into the
							21st century.<br>

							<br>
							<span id="about_jiffydos_64" class='hidden'>
								<br>
								JiffyDOS is a fairly old product, but it should be considered an absolute essential
								on every C64. It is installed internally, replacing the default KERNAL rom. Which 
								means it's not a dead simple plug in the back. But its compatibility and complete 
								integration are worth the effort. It adds a permenant DOS wedge at the READY prompt, 
								and when paired with drives that also support JiffyDOS it dramatically increases 
								the speed of IEC serial transfers.
								<br>
								JiffyDOS is available from <a href="http://store.go4retro.com/jiffydos-kernal-rom-overlay-ic/">Retro Innovations</a> 
								for $20. It's a must have.

								A 1541 might be traditional, but the uIEC/SD is hard to beat. It lets you use a 
								standard SD card as a mass storage device. The uIEC feels like using a CMD HD, 
								except it costs a whole lot less, is much more reliable, quieter operation, and has 
								the benefit of being able to pull the card and plug it into your Mac or PC to 
								transfer data.<br>
								<br>
								If you want to hook it up externally, no soldering required, get the optional 
								Deluxe Daughtercard. If you're adventuresome, good with your hands and want to save
								a few dollars, you can skip the Daughtercard and mount the uIEC/SD inside the C64's
								case.<br>
								<br>
								Best yet, they're readily available from <a href="http://store.go4retro.com/uiec-sd/">Retro Innovations</a> 
								for just $60, Deluxe Daughtercard included.

								Once you have a uIEC/SD Drive, the SD card becomes the new floppy.<br>
								<br>
								SD cards are extremely common. A 1GB SD card costs less than $3 on eBay. And you 
								can buy them in lots of 10 for even less, each with a protective case. They come
								pre-formatted for use on a Mac or PC, but that means they're preformatted for your 
								C64 too!<br>
								<br>
								1GB on a C64 is a huge amount of space. But having several gives you the 
								flexibility to configure different working environments for your 64. You can 
								dedicate a 1GB card just for C64 OS, so it can liberally use temporary storage as
								memory swap space, and more.

						<h2>Networking</h2>

							<span id="about_64nic" class='hidden'>
								<br>
								The 64NIC+ is a 10-Mbit ethernet cartridge, compatible with RR-Net. It already has
								a variety of interesting software projects that make use of it so you can play 
								around with it right away. But it is going to play a central role C64 OS's mission 
								to make a C64 useful again.<br>
								<br>
								RS-232 cartridges like SwiftLink or Turbo232 were once essential pieces to hook up
								a fast modem and get your 64 on the net. But that was a long time ago, and modems 
								are dead. An ethernet cartridge is the new RS-232 cartridge. It's your ticket to
								internet access on your C64.<br>
								<br>
								These are available from <a href="http://store.go4retro.com/uiec-sd/">Retro Innovations</a>
								for a very reasonable $55, including a case. Although you have to put the holes in
								the case yourself.

						<h2>Video</h2>

							An S-Video Converter <a onclick="document.getElementById('about_videoconverter').show();" class='button'>about</a>
							<br>
							<span id="about_videoconverter" class='hidden'>
								<br>
								The one shown here is a mini <a href="http://www.port-ta.com">Portta Video Converter</a>. It's very small, powered via a
								USB cable which you can connect to any USB charger. It has two selectable inputs, 
								either composite video via one RCA jack, or mini-din S-Video. Newer C64s and C128s 
								output S-Video via two RCA jacks. But you can either buy or make cables that will
								join these into a standard S-Video jack.<br>
								<br>
								The video converter outputs 25-pin VGA. This very small, inexpensive converter 
								allows you to hook up your C64 or C128 to a myriad of more modern displays. Big and
								small, light weight, wall mountable, you name it. There are many converters like
								this one available at a range of prices and qualities. But, you do not need to use 
								a traditional Commodore-compatible 13" CRT monitor.

							<span id="about_videotosvideocable" class='hidden'>
								<br>
								While you're busy buying an S-Video to VGA converter, you may have noticed that your
								C64 has two RCA cables that carry the Luma and Chroma signals, rather than a S-Video
								jack. The C64 outputs S-Video compatible signals, but S-Video packages these two 
								signals via a single cable with a mini-din connector.<br>
								<br>
								You can make one of these cables yourself. But why not <a href='http://www.ebay.com/itm/6-Commodore-Video-Monitor-Cable-S-Video-Audio-C-64-C-128-8-PIN-/332028370296'>grab one off eBay</a>
								for about $18 instead? I think these cables are handmade, but they're reliable and 
								professional at a very reasonable price.
